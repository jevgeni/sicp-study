;;  The reason the tolerance is better, when there are no repeated variable is that each time you miltiple or divide the intervals, the tolerance increases. Therefore, it is better to reduce the number of operations to keep the tolerance low.

;; as a suggestion: the  solution could try to reduce the formulas to use of the intervals in minimal places (for example, once, as Eva suggested in previous ex). This could be done if the operations on interval math would not be calculated immediately, as they are done right now, but rather combined for the future processing and optimization...
